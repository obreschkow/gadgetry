Title: Reading, Processing and Visualising Astrophysical N-Body Simulation Data
Version: 0.25
Author: Danail Obreschkow
Maintainer: Danail Obreschkow <danail.obreschkow@gmail.com>
Description: Routines for post-processing and visualising astrophysical N-body+SPH simulation data, in particular data generated by the Gadget code. The routines are most suitable for smaller simulations (up to ~1e8 particles), as they have been written assuming that the simulation particles of individual snapshots can be loaded into RAM memory at once.
