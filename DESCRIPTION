Title: Initialising, Reading, Processing and Visualising Astrophysical N-Body Simulation Data
Version: 0.64

Description: Routines for initialising, post-processing and visualising astrophysical N-body+SPH simulation data, written to deal with data generated by the Gadget code at <https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/gadget4/>. The routines are most suitable for smaller simulations (up to ~1e8 particles), as they have been written assuming that the simulation particles of individual snapshots can be loaded into RAM memory at once.
