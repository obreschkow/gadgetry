\title{Reading, Processing and Visualizing Astrophysical N-Body Simulation Data}
\description{
Routines for intializing, post-processing and visualizing astrophysical N-body+SPH simulation data, mainly intended to be used with the Gadget simulation code (see <https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/gadget4/>). The routines are most suitable for smaller simulations (up to ~1e8 particles), as they have been written assuming that the simulation particles of individual snapshots can be loaded into RAM memory at once.
